Description: Power calculations and hypothesis testing for the difference in mean of two negative binomial distributions
	A set of functions to allow analysis of count data (such
    as faecal egg count data) using Bayesian MCMC methods.  Returns
    information on the possible values for mean count, coefficient
    of variation and zero inflation (true prevalence) present in
    the data.  A complete faecal egg count reduction test (FECRT)
    model is implemented, which returns inference on the true
    efficacy of the drug from the pre- and post-treatment data
    provided, using non-parametric bootstrapping as well as using
    Bayesian MCMC.  Functions to perform power analyses for faecal
    egg counts (including FECRT) are also provided.
	A working installation of JAGS (<http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net>) is required for MCMC-based methods
